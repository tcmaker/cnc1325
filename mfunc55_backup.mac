;---------Example Macro for a Manual Lube Pump Aux Key--------------------------------------
; This Macro will activate the LubePump Logic in PLC and will keep pump on based on Parameter 179.
; Example: Parameter 179 = 1015, Then when this macro is activated the LubePump will have power ON for 15 seconds.
; A “ Lube pump Turn Off” Macro (M95) is not needed as the PLC resets the output in the logic when the ON timer is finished.
; Each time this m code is issued the “G-code running” timer is reset, so in our example P179=1015. After the pump has run for 15
; seconds the “G code running” timer begins again to count down 10 minutes before the next automatic lube cycle.
; This macro can be used during a G code program, for example if the user wishes to pump some extra lube while the job is running.
; Uncomment the M94 Line Below to set Aux 8 VCP Aux key as a manual lube pump one shot button.
; This will set "SV_M94_M95_8" in the PLC, which a system variable used for lube pump operation that is pre-coded in the PLC.

;M94 /8                ;M94 Requests to SET "ManualLubePump" in PLC.

;------------------Example Macro for PopUpPins Output---------------------------
;Use Aux 8 and Aux 9 to Turn on and Off PopUpPins Output
;M94 is used to Turn on a variable in PLC which in turn activates logic in the PLC
;M95 is used to Turn Off the variable
;Remove the ";" infront of code below in mfunc55 and mfunc56 to use

;M94 /30			;Turn on PopUpPins

;-----------------Example Macro for SpindleCooling Output---------------------------
;Uses Aux 8 and Aux 9 to Turn On and Off the SpindleCooling Output
;M94 is used to Turn on a variable in PLC which in turn activates logic in the PLC
;M95 is used to Turn Off the variable
;Remove the ";" infront of the code below in both mfunc55 and mfunc56 to use

;M94 /31			;Turn on SpindleCooling
